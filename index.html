            <p>This is it, the day we are leaving Salt Lake City. The truck is packed (we did this the night before) and we
                are ready to hit the road. Did we hire professional movers? No, we are going to do this ourselves. We have
                a Penske&#8482; truck, two boys, and a cat and this is going to be great.</p>

            <a name="day-1-Broke-Down"></a>
            <p>Well the title says it all. After being on the road for only 10 Minuets we break down. AAs it turns out the steering
                tires on the Penske&#8482; truck we rented needed replacing. We were not even out of the valley we started
                in and the repair took 5 hours for someone to show up and get us going. Needless to say my wife was less
                than pleased.

            <p>Yes, Miracles do happen. Ours came in the form of a working Penske&#8482; truck. At this point it is about 1:30
                pm and we drive for about 3 hours. As a side note this trip may sound cursed and it was. This is the point
                in the story my phone melts it's charcging port.

            <p>Were moving and chewing up the miles. The day is smooth if you don't count the kids being kids. We leave Utah
                and make it to Colorado. As soon as we are in the state the terain changes and the mountains are uppon us.
                This part of the drive includes sharp curves, tunnels through mountains and steep climbs/decents.
